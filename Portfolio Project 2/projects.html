        <h2>Programming and Web Skills</h2> 
        <p>I developed an Online Banking System, a friendly user interface created using Java, through Eclipse IDE and Scene Builder, SQL, XML.
           It gives clients the option to retrieve and transfer money, deposit cheques, and check current balances. These functions provide a seamless experience to client-based users.

           I created a two-player Yahtzee Game Project that runs on a local host server, using JavaScript, jQuery, Node and Express.js, and CSS to design an appealing visual experience for users. 
           It allows players to roll dice and keep track of scores, along with an option to restart or leave the game.

           I established a Hospital Triage App using JavaScript, Node and Express.js and CSS. 
           The app illustrates severity of injuries and waiting times of patients, which overall improved the communication between staff and customers for hospitals.

        <h2>Communication and Writing</h2> 
        <p>I have led our group projects through collaborative teamwork and effective communication to achieve team goals, resulting in the fruition of three functioning apps and services for users.

           Writing is a personal skill of mine. I have written an A+ critical thinking essay on Hobbesâ€™ moral viewpoint of life.
